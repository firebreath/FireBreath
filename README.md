FireBreath is a cross-platform browser plugin framework. It supports ActiveX and NPAPI on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (probably other UNIX-derivatives as well).

Getting the source
==================

After checking out the source, make sure you run:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

in the project root to get the linked repositories.  The main one you want is the firebreath-boost repository.  You don't need firebreath-boost if you use WITH_SYSTEM_BOOST.

Using Subversion
================

If you choose to use subversion to check out FireBreath, make sure you also check out the firebreath-boost project as src/3rdParty/boost/ (you'll have to remove the existing directory).



Good luck!
