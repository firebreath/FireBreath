The browser calls NPP_WriteReady before each call to NPP_Write to determine whether a plug-in can
receive data and how many bytes it can receive. This function allows the browser to send only as
much data to the instance as it can handle at one time, making resource use more efficient for
both the browser and plug-in.

The NPP_Write function may pass a larger buffer, but the plug-in is required to consume only the
amount of data returned by NPP_WriteReady.

The browser can write a smaller amount of data if desired or necessary; for example, if only 8K of
data is available in a network buffer. If the plug-in is allocating memory for the entire stream
at once (an AS_FILE stream), it can return a very large number. Because it is not processing
streaming data, the browser can pass as much data to the instance as necessary in a single
NPP_Write.

If the plug-in receives a value of zero, the data flow temporarily stops. The browser checks to
see if the plug-in can receive data again by resending the data at regular intervals.

The browser calls the NPP_Write function to deliver the data specified in a previous
NPP_WriteReady call to the plug-in. A plug-in must consume at least as many bytes as indicated in
the NPP_WriteReady call.

After a stream is created by a call to NPP_NewStream, the browser calls NPP_Write either:

    * If the plug-in requested a normal-mode stream, the data in the stream is delivered to the
      plug-in instance in a series of calls to NPP_WriteReady and NPP_Write.
    * If the plug-in requested a seekable stream, the NPN_RequestRead function requests reads of
      a specified byte range that results in a series of calls to NPP_WriteReady and NPP_Write.

The plug-in can use the offset parameter to track the bytes that are written. This gives you
different information depending in the type of stream. In a normal-mode stream., the parameter
value increases as the each buffer is written. The buf parameter is not persistent, so the plug-in
must process data immediately or allocate memory and save a copy of it. In a seekable stream with
byte range requests, you can use this parameter to track NPN_RequestRead requests.

user action (for example, clicking the Stop button), and NPRES_NETWORK_ERR, indicating that the
request could not be completed, perhaps because the URL could not be found.

NPP_Print is called when the user requests printing for a web page that contains a visible plug-in

printInfo parameter to determine whether the plug-in should print as an embedded plug-in or as a
full-page plug-in.

    * An embedded plug-in shares printing with the browser; the plug-in prints the part of the
      page it occupies, and the browser handles everything else, including displaying print dialog
      boxes, getting the printer device context, and any other tasks involved in printing, as well
      as printing the rest of the page. For an embedded plug-in, set the printInfo field to
      NPEmbedPrint.
    * A full-page plug-in handles all aspects of printing itself. For a full-page plug-in, set the
      printInfo field to NPFullPrint or null.

For information about printing on your platform, see your platform documentation.
MS Windows

On MS Windows printInfo->print.embedPrint.platformPrint is the device context (DC) handle. Be sure
to cast this to type HDC.

The coordinates for the window rectangle are in TWIPS format. This means that you need to convert
the x-y coordinates using the Windows API call DPtoLP when you output text.

responsible for delivering to the plug-in, see the NPEvent structure.

MS Windows
----------
The browser gives each windowed plug-in its own native window, often a child window of the browser
window, to draw into. The plug-in has complete control over drawing and event handling within that
window.

Mac OS
------
The browser does not give a windowed plug-in a native window, because the Mac OS platform does not
support child windows. Instead, the windowed plug-in draws into the graphics port associated with
the the browser window, at the offset that the browser specifies. For this reason, NPP_HandleEvent
is only way the plug-in can receive events from its host application on Mac OS. When
NPP_HandleEvent is called, the current port is set up so that its origin matches the top-left
corner of the plug-in. A plug-in does not need to set up the current port for mouse coordinate
translation.

stream in stream->pdata. The MIME type of the stream is provided by the type parameter.

embedded instance, or the file itself, for a full-page instance. A plug-in can also request a
stream with the function NPN_GetURL. The browser calls NPP_DestroyStream when the stream completes
(either successfully or abnormally). The plug-in can terminate the stream itself by calling
NPN_DestroyStream.
